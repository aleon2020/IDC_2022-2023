## 1. Exercises proposed during the course

Directories ['Ejercicios Parte 1'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/tree/main/Ejercicios%20Parte%201) and ['Ejercicios Parte 2'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/tree/main/Ejercicios%20Parte%202): Within each of these directories are all the exercises that have been completed in class. Those in Part 1 correspond to the concepts covered in the midterm exam, while those in Part 2 correspond to the concepts covered in the final exam for the subject.

**NOTE**: You can see that some exercises are contained in a directory and others are not, since those that are contained in a directory contain MATLAB code that was used to solve and, in turn, simulate the exercise; while the others are purely theoretical.

## 2. Forms

In addition, the files ['Formulario Parcial 1.pdf'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/blob/main/Formulario%20Parcial%201.pdf) and ['Formulario Parcial 2.pdf'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/blob/main/Formulario%20Parcial%202.pdf) correspond to each of the forms that can be taken to the exam as support material (maximum length of 2 pages).

## 3. Practices and problems

Directory ['Prácticas'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/tree/main/Pr%C3%A1cticas): Contains everything about the 3 practices carried out throughout the course (statement, paper solutions, source code, reports, etc.).

Directory ['Problemas'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/tree/main/Problemas): Contains everything about the 2 problems completed throughout the course (statement, paper solutions, source code, reports, etc.).

**NOTE**: When submitting both the practical exercises and the problems, it is mandatory to submit a report with all the explanations and the MATLAB code used. This is done by filling in the blanks reserved in the statements of each of these submissions (compressed files problem_X_text_aula_virtual.zip and practica_X_text_aula_virtual.zip) for which LATEX (LaTeXila tool) is used.

## 4. Using the programs

To use and view the source code, you must download the compressed file corresponding to the exercise. To do this:

- From Github, click on the compressed file corresponding to the exercise solution (exercise_X.zip).

- Then, click on the 'View raw' option, this will download the compressed file.

- Finally, from the folder where the compressed file was downloaded, drag it to your MATLAB file manager, and then you'll be able to use the source code for the exercise.

## 5. References

Files ['Libro de la asignatura (Parte 1).pdf'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/blob/main/Libro%20de%20la%20asignatura%20(Parte%201).pdf) and ['Libro de la asignatura (Parte 2).pdf'](https://github.com/aleon2020/IDC_2022-2023/blob/main/Libro%20de%20la%20asignatura%20(Parte%202).pdf): These are the two support books used to address the theoretical content of the subject, although in most cases the study material used is everything covered in the MATLAB simulations.
